# Hi I'm Kiera Navarro!

I'm a 3rd year Math-CS student at UC San Diego
I'm fairly involved on student organizations on campus; I am an ...
- [X] Event Host for the Cyber Community in Association of Computing Machinery (ACM)
- [X] Outreach/Events Coordinator for Girl Gains

My career goal is to become an Information Security Engineer and Analyst. I've been working as a student intern at Intel for about 1.5 years. My internship has helped me understand the daily operations of a security organization and how to work in an agile team. I have also earned the ISC<sup>2</sup> [Certified in Cybersecurity](https://www.isc2.org/certified-in-cybersecurity?filter=featured&searchRoot=A82B5ABE5FF04271998AE8A4B5D7DEFD) certification, and I'm currently studying for the CompTIA [Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security) certification. 



## My technical experience

* **Languages**: Java, Python, C, C++, Assembly, HTML, MATLAB, YAML, Splunk SPL
* **Tools**: Linux, UNIX, Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, Junit, Git, GitHub, BlueJ 

I'm comfortable using Markdown; I first learned markdown in CSE 12/15L and I continued using it to write out my notes for CSE 100 and other courses. I'm also experienced in HTML and I've used it in my internship. <br>
However, I had to relearn Git from when I took CSE 15L in my first year. I did so by creating a test branch and playing around with it
> git branch test-git

But I encountered some issues trying to delete my branch (locally and remotely), so I used several of these commands to delete the test branch (help from [here](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/delete-remote-branch) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2003505/how-do-i-delete-a-git-branch-locally-and-remotely))
```
git push -d origin test-git
git branch -D test-git
git push origin --delete test-git
git worktree prune
git fetch test-git --prune
```
