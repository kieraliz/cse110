# Hi I'm Kiera Navarro!

I'm a 3rd year Math-CS student at UC San Diego

## My technical experience

* **Languages**: Java, Python, C, C++, Assembly, HTML, MATLAB, YAML, Splunk SPL
* **Tools**: Linux, UNIX, Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, Junit, Git, GitHub, BlueJ 

I'm comfortable using Markdown; I first learned markdown in CSE 12/15L and I continued using it to write out my notes for CSE 100 and other courses. I'm also experienced in HTML and I've used it in my internship. <br>
However, I had to relearn Git from when I took CSE 15L in my first year. I did so by creating a test branch and playing around with it
> git branch test-git

But I encountered some issues trying to delete my branch (locally and remotely), so I used several of these commands to delete the test branch (help from [here](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/delete-remote-branch) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2003505/how-do-i-delete-a-git-branch-locally-and-remotely))
```
git push -d origin test-git
git branch -D test-git
git push origin --delete test-git
git worktree prune
git fetch test-git --prune
```

My personal goal is to ...
- [ ] Learn how to work in a SWE team
- [ ] Pass CSE 110 and make a nice project
- [ ] Graduate in June 2025
- [ ] Land a full-time job
